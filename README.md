# ShiftEnter

###ShiftEnterFinal.ipynb
Contains the heart of our code, alongside the major write-up for our project.

All of the functions and analysis that we completed is done with the code in this section, with the datasets being prepped within some of the other notebooks. The beginning of the notebook comprimises our write-up that discusses the scope and objective of our project.

###data_collection.ipynb
Our mechanism to concatenate and clean data across years.

Before entering the center stage of our coding, we used the functions in this dataset to grab the appropriate span of data.

###data_collection_sup.ipynb
Rough draft

Might be useful for you to see our thought process and some of earlier tests. The wreckage of our old ideas lie here.

###Folders and index.html
Folders contain either datasets or the building blocks of the website.

Index.html is where our website is based out of, for its current GitHub pages iteration.
